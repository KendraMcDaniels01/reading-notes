# Class 04 - Reading Notes

## React Docs - Forms

**1) What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**
A "React component that renders a form also and controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input." 

**2) Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into 
state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their
 responses as soon as they enter them? Why.** 
 "Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types."
 
**3) How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**
"Add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name"


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

**1) Why would we use a ternary operator?**
condenses if statements to a single line of code.
    
**2)Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**    
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
x===y ? true : false;
