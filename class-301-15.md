1) What is OAuth? OAuth allows one application to act on behalf of the user by obtaining 
limited access to the user's resources from another application, without
 exposing the user's credentials

3) How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? User initiates authentication ->  third-party application requests authorization -> Authorization server provides a token -> third-party application uses the access token to access the user's data -> User's data is accessed
