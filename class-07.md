## Domain Modeling

**1) Explain why we need domain modeling.**
  Domain modeling is a crucial process in software development that 
involves creating representations of real-world systems, processes, or 
concepts within a specific problem domain. These models serve as a 
bridge between the problem domain and the software solution. 
## HTML Table Basics

**1) Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**
Tables used for layout purposes pose challenges 
for users relying on screen readers. Screen readers interpret tables as 
data structures, which may lead to confusion and difficulty in 
understanding the content's layout and structure. When tables are used for layout, they often result in a tangled mess of 
tags and nested elements, commonly referred to as "tag soup." This 
convoluted code structure makes the HTML harder to read, maintain, and 
troubleshoot.
    
**2) List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.**
* th - Table header 
* tr - table row
* td - table data
  
### Introducing Constructors

**1) What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**
A constructor is a special function in JavaScript that serves as a 
blueprint for creating objects with a predefined structure and behavior.
 It acts as a template to define the initial state and functionality of 
objects. Using constructors offers several advantages, particularly when
 needing to create multiple objects.

**2) How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
When "this" is used inside an object literal, it refers to the object 
itself where the function or method containing "this" is defined. In the context of a constructor, "this" points to the newly created instance of the object that is being constructed.
                                                     
### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

**1) Explain prototypes and inheritance**
In JavaScript, prototypes are a mechanism through which objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Inheritance is the process by which an object acquires properties. Objects can access and use methods and properties defined using the prototype keyword, making code reuse and structuring more efficient.
