## React Docs - Thinking in React

**1) What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?**
The idea that components should "ideally only do one thing".
**2) What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?**
It means building a version of your app that doesn't require any user interactivity. 
**3) Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?**
Add in user input by using state.
**4) What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?**
" Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
  Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!"
**5) How can you identify where state needs to live?**
"Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy.
Decide where the state should live:
Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
If you can’t find a component where it 
makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding 
the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent 
component."


## Higher-Order Functions

**1) What is a “higher-order function”?**
"Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them"
**2) Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?**
Line 2 is the return statement for the greaterThan function. This function is returning a function. 
**3) Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.**
Both map and reduce are higher-order functions that work with arrays. map is used for transforming each element of an array and returning a new array, while reduce is used for combining values into a single result.
