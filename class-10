## Troubleshooting JavaScript

**1) Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
* Syntax Error: errors that the compiler or interpreter points out the exact location of the error in 
the code, usually with an error message that describes the issue.
* Logic Error: incorrect code logic

**2) List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**  
Most of my errors so far have been missing a paranthesis or bracket somewhere or misspelling something. To fix it I have looked at what went wrong then stared at that section of code till I found the mistake. 

**3) How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
 Debugging is a crucial skill for developers as it ensures code 
correctness, improves reliability, and contributes to user satisfaction.
 It is an iterative and continuous process that allows you to produce 
high-quality code.
      
     
## The JavaScript Debugger

**1) How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool?**
The JavaScript Debugger is a built-in tool available in modern 
web browsers that allows developers to inspect and debug JavaScript code
 running in a web page. It provides various features and functionalities
 to help developers identify and fix errors, analyze code execution, and
 understand their JavaScript.

**2) Define what a breakpoint is.**
a breakpoint is a point in the source code where the 
program's execution is paused, allowing developers to 
inspect the state of the program at that particular moment.
 
**3) What is the call stack?**
It keeps track of the active function calls and their execution 
contexts, allowing the program to maintain the proper order of function 
invocations and return values
