Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

The decline of women in computer science occurred around the same time as the personal computer revolution in the 1980s. The rise of personal computers was accompanied by marketing that often targeted males, leading to a perception that computers were a "boys' toy."
The decline was also influenced by various cultural and societal factors, including stereotypes and gender bias that discouraged women from pursuing computer science and technology-related careers.
The fact that males had greater access and exposure to computers from a young age contributed to a gender gap in technology fields. It created an early interest and familiarity with technology that was not as prevalent among females.
This early exposure and experience can give males an advantage in pursuing technology-related careers, as they may have a head start in building relevant skills and confidence.

Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?
Why do diverse companies perform better?
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Diversity efforts are most successful when they are integrated into a company's culture and values rather than being seen as a separate initiative. Successful diversity efforts are ongoing, not just occasional programs.
Diverse companies often perform better because they can tap into a wider range of perspectives and experiences, leading to more innovative and creative solutions, better problem-solving, and a broader understanding of their customer base.
An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is a technology company that creates products that are accessible to people of different backgrounds, abilities, and needs. For instance, a company might design inclusive user interfaces and accessibility features in their software or hardware to cater to users with various requirements.
