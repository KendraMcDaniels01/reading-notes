## HTML Forms

**1) Why are forms so important in web development?**
 Forms facilitate communication and interaction between users and websites. They provide a
 means for users to submit data and interact with the website's backend 
or server.

**2) When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**  
Considering user experience (UX), it's crucial to bear in mind that 
larger forms carry the risk of frustrating users and driving them away. 
To ensure a positive experience, prioritize simplicity and focus by 
requesting only the essential data you truly require.

**3) List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**
* /<form>: It serves as a container for various form elements 
* /<label>: represents a label for other form elements
* /<input>: used to create various types of input fields within a form
* /<textarea>: for cases where users need to provide more text
* /<button>:  used in conjunction with JavaScript to perform specific functions when clicked
      
     
## Learn JS

**1) How would you describe events?**
Events in JavaScript provide the means to create interactive and 
responsive websites for users actions and other occurrences in the browser. 

**2) When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**
* Event Type:'click', 'keydown', 'mouseover', 'submit', 'load', 'scroll'
* Callback Function: a function that will be executed when the specified event occurs
 
**3) Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**
when an event is triggered, the browser automatically creates an "event 
object." This object contains information about the event that occurred.

**4) What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**
Event Bubbling: 
 * default behavior
 * allows you to handle events on both the target element and its parents
Event Capturing:
 * event is first captured at the root of the document
