## [Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)

1) Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? RESTful APIs are designed around the principles of CRUD
2) If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  - Design the API: Define the resources (objects) your API will expose. Determine the URIs (endpoints) for these resources.
  - Choose HTTP Methods: Assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to CRUD operations for each resource.
  - Implement the Endpoints: Write code to handle requests and perform CRUD operations for each endpoint. Map routes and actions.
  - Handle Data: Set up a data store (usually a database) to store and retrieve the resources.
  - Test and Document: Thoroughly test each endpoint for correctness and performance. Create clear documentation for your API, including details about endpoints, request and response structures, and any     authentication or security considerations.
