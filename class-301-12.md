1) In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:    
100’s = server has received the request

400’s = client's request contains incorrect or incomplete information
500’s = issue on the server side

2) What is a status code 202? processing has not been completed
3) What is a status code 308? requests should be repeated

1) Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env? provides security and flexibility

3) What does app.use(express.json()) do? middleware that parses incoming JSON requests
4) What does the /:id mean in a route? /:id in a route is a route parameter
5) What is the difference between PUT and PATCH? PUT is used to update or replace an entire object, PATCH is used to partially update an object
6) How do you make a default value in a schema? using the default property
7) What does a 500 error status code mean? something went wrong on the server side 
8) What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? Status 200 (OK) indicates a successful request, Status 201 (Created) indicates a successful request that has led to the creation of a new object
