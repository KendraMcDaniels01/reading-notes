# class-05 Reading Notes

## Using Images

**1) What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
  Alternate text is for when the image does not load like when it renders slowly due to a slow connection. The text can also be used in search queries.

**2) How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**  
  Don't use tooltips on images because the screen reader can be unpredictable and the tooltip will only show up if you hover of ther image. 

**3) Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
  Figure elements supply a container to clearly link the image with its caption shich can be good for when you have multiple images on a page. 
  
**4) Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image.**
  GIF is commonly used for simple animations and indexed images with a limited color palette.
  SVG is preferred for scalable graphics, allowing precise rendering at any size and supporting modifications through code or editing software.
  
**4) What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
  Png is likely the best so that you don't lose too much quality, making the image unreadable (especially text)
