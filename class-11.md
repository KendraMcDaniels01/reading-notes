**1) Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**
The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved from a limited
 and plugin-dependent approach to a seamless and standardized 
integration

**2) Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.**  
When using the src attribute, you specify the video file that needs to be played, and by including the controls attribute, you provide users with the necessary playback controls to interact with the video.

**3) Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?**
To include fallback content, you can place text, an image, or a link between the <video>
 tags. This content will be displayed if the browser does not support 
the video format or if there are any issues with loading the video.

**4) Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.**
Audio and Video became inseparable companions, spreading happiness and 
wonder wherever they roamed. They showed the world that when combined, 
the harmony of sound and the allure of visuals could create an 
enchanting experience that touched the hearts of all who encountered 
them.
