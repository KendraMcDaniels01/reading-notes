## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1) What is functional programming? "computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data"
2) What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? Always produces the same output for the same input.
3) What are the benefits of a pure function? 
 - Predictability: Since pure functions always produce the same output for the same input, they are predictable 
 - Testability: easy to test because you can test them in isolation 
 - Concurrency: can be used in concurrent and parallel programming
 - Modularity: reusable code
4) What is immutability? once an object is created, it cannot be modified.
5) What is Referential transparency? a function's output can be replaced by its return value 

## [Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

1) What is a module? n Node.js, a module is a reusable block of code
2) What does the word ‘require’ do? used to include (import) modules in a Node.js application
3) How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?const myModule = require().
4) What do we have to do to make a module available? module.exports
