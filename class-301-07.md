## [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1) What is node.js? Node.js is an open-source, JavaScript runtime environment
 that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. 
2) In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is an open-source JavaScript engine 
developed by Google. It's designed to execute JavaScript code in web 
browsers. 
3) What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?  It allows developers to run JavaScript on servers
4) What is npm? (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js. It allows 
developers to easily install, manage, and share packages and libraries.  
5) What version of node are you running on your machine?
6) What version of npm are you running on your machine?
7) What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? 
npm install jshint
8) What is node used for? It's particularly well-suited for real-time applications, data streaming, and building scalable network applications. 

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1) What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? 
- Improved Code Quality: With two sets of eyes, it's more likely that issues will be caught before they become problems.
- Knowledge Sharing: Team members can share their individual knowledge and learn from each other. This helps in skill development and promotes a culture of learning.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Working in pairs encourages team collaboration and open communication. It's easier to discuss ideas and solve problems.
- Faster Problem Solving: Two heads are often better than one. When one developer gets stuck, the other can provide insights and solutions more quickly.
- Better Design: Pair programming can lead to better software design. The discussion during pair programming can result in more thoughtful and efficient code.
- Reduced Bus Factor: The "bus factor" refers to the risk of key persons being hit by a bus. Pair programming can help mitigate this risk since more than one person understands the codebase.

2) In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? I haven't had much experience with pair programming since I have been in self paced.
3) How does pair programming work? Pair programming typically works like this:
Driver and Navigator: In a pair, one person is the "driver," responsible for typing out the code, while the other is the "navigator," responsible for reviewing and thinking about the big picture. They switch roles periodically.
