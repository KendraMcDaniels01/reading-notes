## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

1) To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience? The last team I was apart of had fairly poor psychological safety; 
unfortunately fairly common office culture. During challenging projects 
or periods of high workload. Instead of offering encouragement and 
understanding, team members were often criticized for not meeting strict
 deadlines or for perceived mistakes. This fostered a culture of blame 
and fear of failure, further inhibiting open dialogue and the sharing of
 concerns. 
2) How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward? Psychological safety fosters an environment where team members feel 
comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions without fear of judgment or
 criticism. As a result, team members are more likely to contribute 
innovative and creative solutions to problems, leading to improved 
products, services, and processes for the company.

## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1) Who is Roy Fielding? "He helped write the first web servers"
2) Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? We don't utilize REST.
4) What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? "an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to."
5) What does a GET do? It requests data from a specified resource. It should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.
6) What does a POST do? It is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It 
can also be used to create a new resource. It often results in a change 
in the state of the resource.
7) What does PUT do?  It is used to update a current resource with new data, or to create a new resource if it does not exist.
8) What does PATCH do? It is used to apply partial modifications
