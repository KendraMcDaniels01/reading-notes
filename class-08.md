## Learn CSS - Flexbox

**1) Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
 Flexbox is a layout model in CSS designed specifically for handling 
one-dimensional content, either in a row (horizontal) or a column 
(vertical). It automatically adjusts the size and alignment of items based on 
available space, reducing the need for complex calculations and manual 
positioning.

**2) Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**  
 The main axis is defined by the "flex-direction" property, which can be 
set to either "row" (horizontal) or "column" (vertical). It represents 
the primary direction along which flex items are arranged. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis and is determined by 
the opposite direction of the main axis. If the main axis is set to 
"row," the cross axis will be "column," and vice versa.

**3) How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
Screen readers typically follow the source order to understand the content's structure and context. When flex properties alter this order, it can disrupt the reading flow, making it harder for users to comprehend the information. To ensure good accessibility, developers should use flex properties judiciously and consider the logical reading order when rearranging items using CSS. 
      
     
## CSS Layout - Flexbox

**1) What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**
Flexbox provides a simpler and more intuitive way to format multiple 
items inside a parent container. It allows for easy alignment, 
distribution, and reordering of elements, making complex layouts much 
easier to achieve compared to using floats. It simplifies the formatting of elements, provides equal space 
distribution, and ensures consistent column heights, making it a 
preferred choice for modern web design.

**2) How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**
Not one for CSS, so anything to make it easier is something I look forward to using.
